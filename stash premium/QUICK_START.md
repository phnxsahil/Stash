## 🔧 Technical Details

### Built With
- **React** 18.3.1
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS** 4.0
- **Lucide Icons**

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Nothing happens when I click Connect"
→ Check browser console for errors

### "Preview won't play"
→ Expected - this is a visual prototype. Real previews require Spotify API.

### "My songs disappear on refresh"
→ Expected - data is stored in-memory. Production will use a database.

### "Delete button won't appear"
→ Make sure to hover over the song item (desktop) or tap once (mobile)
