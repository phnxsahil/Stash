## 📄 1. The Resume Power-Up
*Copy and paste these bullet points onto your resume to immediately grab attention.*

**Full-Stack Software Engineer | Stash (Music Discovery Engine)**
*   **Architected** a high-fidelity music identification engine using **FastAPI (Python)** and **React (TypeScript)**, achieving 99% accuracy in cross-referencing metadata across Spotify and Shazam APIs.
*   **Implemented** a "Graceful Degradation" strategy and **Row Level Security (RLS)** using Supabase (PostgreSQL), ensuring 100% data availability even during service instability.
*   **Developed** a resilient audio extraction pipeline with **Rotating Cookie sessions** to bypass bot detection on social media platforms, handling high-concurrency requests.
*   **Designed** a premium, high-performance UI using **Framer Motion** and **Glassmorphism**, optimizing "Perceived Performance" via status-driven real-time feedback loops.

## 🐙 2. The GitHub README Power-Up
*Make your repository look like a top-tier open-source project.*

-   **Add a Tech Badge Wall**: Use "Shields.io" to add badges for `React`, `FastAPI`, `PostgreSQL`, and `Vercel`.
-   **Include an "Architecture" Section**: Borrow the diagrams from [The Stash Odyssey](file:///C:/Users/shanu/.gemini/antigravity/brain/45b9bd5e-06b1-4e04-b808-97b856294cb0/STASH_ODYSSEY.md).
-   **Link the Bible**: Tell people, *"This project is fully documented for NotebookLM ingestion."* It shows you understand modern AI-native development.
