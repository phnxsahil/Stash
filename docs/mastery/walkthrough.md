# Stash Master Bible: Project Completion

I have successfully crafted the **Stash Master Bible**—a comprehensive, book-length guide designed to give you total mastery over the project.

## Key Chapters Accomplished
- **Chapter 0: Magic for Muggles**: ELI5 foundations of Functions, React, and APIs.
- **Chapter 2: The Brain's Attic**: A deep-dive into the FastAPI backend and `yt-dlp` recognition.
- **Chapter 4: The Component Safari**: Granular documentation of every major UI element (AppView, StatsView, etc.).
- **Chapter 6 & 7: The Fortress & World Domination**: Security, Spotify OAuth, and scaling strategies for growth.

## How to use this Bible
- **For Mastery**: Read it sequentially like a book to understand how the "Zero-Failure" engine works from the inside out.
- **For NotebookLM**: This file is highly structured and context-rich, making it a perfect source to feed into NotebookLM for quick Q&A about your project.
